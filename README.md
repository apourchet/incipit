# dummy
A boilerplate for a scalable Kubernetes/Docker backed infrastructure.

# Features
- Redis single-node
- Etcd clustered
- Ingress with TLS and path-based-routing
- Environment-independent build targets

# Goal
Provide a clean, robust example of a scalable backend that is also language-agnostic
and easy to develop on; while still benefitting from the microservice architecture.
